## [3.8.0.1002] - 2024-09-30 [Feature Release]

### Added

- Add --socket option for sfptpdctl to control multiple processes. (SWPTP-624)
- Add support for interpolating values into file paths and other output.
  - Configurable patterns for log, state, control and stats paths. (SWPTP-649)
  - Configurable patterns for clock names and ids. (SWPTP-997)
  - See [example config](config/option-examples.cfg) for specification.
- Enhance LACP support. (SWPTP-738)
  - Add support for dual boundary clock topology by sending DelayReq
    messages over the physical interface that last received a Sync message
    from the current PTP master. Uses a pool of sockets for multicast.
    To enable, see [example](config/ptp_slave_lacp.cfg). (SWPTP-976)
  - Switch the local reference clock to be the one by which the latest Sync
    message was timestamped. (SWPTP-1434)
- Show unicast/multicast delay response flags in state file. (SWPTP-807)
- Get transmit timestamps via epoll to avoid blocking PTP thread. (SWPTP-831)
- Add interpolated config of patterns for clock names and ids. (SWPTP-997)
- Ethtool queries are now conducted over netlink instead of ioctl on kernels
  where this is supported. (SWPTP-1304)
- IP address of parent clock added to topology files (SWPTP-1312)
- Add option to configure state file and stats log update rates. (SWPTP-1326)
  - e.g. `reporting_intervals save_state 120 stats_log 2`
- Add `step_threshold` option to change the offset threshold for allowing
  a step (when permitted by clock control setting). (SWPTP-1365)
- Add shared clock feed. (SWPTP-1386)
  - Deliver clock comparisons via shared feed, nearly halving the number
    of measurements needed in a multi-NIC system.
  - Reduce impact of missing and delayed clock measurements
- Use 1588-2019 method for constructing clock ids from EUI-64s. (SWPTP-1402)
  - Allow unique clock id bits to be set with `unique_clockid_bits`.
  - Allow legacy (2008) clock ids to be used with `legacy_clock_ids`.
- Add `pidadjust` control command to tweak PID controller co-efficients
  at runtime for experimental purposes only. Run `sfptpdctl` without
  arguments to see syntax. (SWPTP-1411)
- Always set NIC clocks on startup by default. The previous behaviour of
  only setting them when not already set or if used as PTP master or with
  a freerunning clock instance can be configured. (SWPTP-1431)
- Add Debian packaging. (SWPTP-1446)
- Add `-D` command line option to specify default PTP domain. (SWPTP-1454)
- Add master-only PTP option. (SWPTP-1459)
- Add a privileged helper to support hotplugging, connecting to the chrony
  control socket and performing clock control over chrony when running as a
  non-root user. (SWPTP-1479)
- Allow repeated -v arguments as convenience to increase verbosity. (SWPTP-1489)

### Added for unsupported source builds only

- Allow 32-bit userspace on 64-bit kernels. (SWPTP-181)
- Add `gps` sync module to use `gpsd` for PPS time of day.
  - Build with `make NO_GPS=` having installed `libgps-dev`.
  - Instantiate the `gps` sync module giving connection details, e.g.
    `gpsd ::1 2947` and set as time of day source.
- Add Y2038 support when built for 32-bit targets with 64-bit time enabled.
  (Xilinx-CNS/sfptpd#12)

### Changed

- Default polling interval for chronyd doubled to 2s.
- Default value of `one_phc_per_nic` is now `off`. (SWPTP-1348)
   - See note under [v3.5.0.1004](#3501004---2022-05-13-feature-release)
     and the [README](README.md#using-non-solarflare-network-adapters).
- Default threshold to step rather than slew reduced to 900ms. (SWPTP-1519)
   - This avoids asymmetric behaviour for offsets slightly above or below
     1.0s as can occur with a leap second or when an erroneous 1s step is
     corrected.

### Removed

- The source can no longer be built on RHEL 6, which is unsupported. (But it
  may be possible to build for RHEL 6 on RHEL 7 by defining `GLIBC_COMPAT=1`
  or with `RPM_OSVER=el6 make build_srpm`.) (SWPTP-1371)

### Fixed

- Issue SWPTP-1396
  - Provide correct clock timestamps in real time stats corresponding to the
    reported offsets rather than time of logging message.
- Issue SWPTP-1481
  - When `max_missing_delayresps` config supplied, stop using the wrong
    value for hybrid fallback.
- Issue SWPTP-1515
  - Fix issue with BMC discriminator disqualifying sources when evaluated
    inbetween Sync and FollowUp reception.
- Xilinx-CNS/sfptpd#9
  - Fix issue that manifests as not being able to control the system clock
    on some systems, such as Raspberry Pi 5 with Debian 12.

## [3.7.1.1007] - 2024-01-25

### Added

- Command line enhancements to support container usage. (SWPTP-1401)
  - Allow config to be read from stdin with `-f -`
  - Add `--console` option to redirect logs to console
- Add configurable missing delay response thresholds (SWPTP-897)
  - `max_missing_delayresps <for-alarm> <for-hybrid-fallback>`
  - default changed from `3 3` to `5 3`.

### Changed

- Python scripts reorganised (SWPTP-1416)
  - New RPM package `sfptpd-python3` contains all the Python code
  - Base `sfptpd` package does not depend on Python.
  - Chrony control script moved to `/usr/libexec`.
  - Example python scripts for customisation do not have a shebang.
  - Chrony clock control can now be enabled with `clock_control on` instead
    of specifying a path to the helper script.

> [!NOTE]
> Configurations using the old example chronyd script location will have the
> new location substituted for compatibility but it is advised to replace this
> with a simple `clock_control on` configuration unless this script has been
> customised for the user's system.

- Add sync-instances file showing factors influencing selection (SWPTP-1286)
- Add ntp and servo logging modules for targetted diagnostics (SWPTP-1291)
- Reflect external constraints (`ntpd`, `chronyd`) as selection rule (SWPTP-1295)
- Better quality logging and trace on hotplug events (SWPTP-1300)
- IP address of parent clock added to state and nodes files (SWPTP-1312)
- Better init system integration with new command line options and

  ```
  --daemon       supersedes now-deprecated 'daemon' config file option
  --no-daemon    overrides now-deprecated 'daemon' config file option
  --version      outputs version number
  --test-config  tests configuration file
  --user USER[:GROUP]
  ```
- Support up to 6 destinations for PTP event monitoring messages (SWPTP-1340)
- Add `sfptpmon` script to receive PTP event monitoring messages (SWPTP-1342)
- Accept any port for unicast PTP event monitoring destinations (SWPTP-1346)
- The `ntpsec` implementation of ntpd available in the EPEL repositories for
     RHEL 9 is confirmed to be fully interoperable with sfptpd, allowing
     system clock disciplining to be controlled at runtime.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The root user is required if the `chronyd` clock control script example
> is used to restart `chronyd`

> [!NOTE]
> All options for `hotplug_detection_mode` other than the synonyms `auto` and
> `netlink` are now redundant and ignored. None of the old modes has any
> benefit over the new netlink implementation, which eliminates many
> system calls.

### Removed

  - Fix retrieval of transmit timestamps to recover from nic reset quicker
- Issue SWPTP-1290
  - Fix failure subsequently to enable timestamps when started with empty bond

  - Fix `ntpd` client handling to avoid quitting when peer stats not available

> [!WARNING]
> Where sfptpd clients emit Rx Sync Timing Data event monitoring they need
> to be updated from older versions at the same time as upgrading from
> an sfptpd remote monitor or the monitored data will be unusable.
> This only applies to users of the `mon_rx_sync_timing_data` option.

## [3.6.0.1015] - 2023-01-30 [Feature Release]

### Added

- Support Xilinx Alveo X3522 Ethernet adapters (SWPTP-1162)
- Support for operating alongside the chronyd service is now provided in a
  separate 'crny' sync module from the 'ntp' module used for ntpd, e.g.
    ```
    [general]
    sync_module crny crny1
    ```
  To aid the transition from existing behaviour under the 'ntp' sync module
  a suitable instance is created implicitly. To **disable** the implicit
  sync instance for simplified logging and diagnostics, specify a sync module
  with no instances:
    ```
    [general]
    sync_module crny
    ```
- Allow user-defined scripts to reconfigure and restart a chronyd service
  as a workaround to lack of a 'clock control' facility in chronyd. This
  brings parity in the supportable use cases of ntpd and chronyd. (SWPTP-1216)
    ```
    [crny]
    control_script /usr/share/doc/sfptpd/examples/chrony_clockcontrol.py
    ```
- Allow operation but block system clock updates when an uncontrollable
  chronyd service is running, except when this condition holds at startup.
  This is improved behaviour when the conflict is transient. It is, however,
  recommended in such situations to configure sfptpd explicitly to treat
  the system clock as read only. To disable this check at startup,
  configure as follows. (SWPTP-1266)
    ```
    [general]
    ignore_critical clock-control-conflict
    ```
- Allow operation in the absence of a kernel PTP subsystem or PTP and PPS
  without a PTP hardware clock. This change supports esoteric and diagnostic
  use cases but is not recommended or supported in production. (SWPTP-1207)
    ```
    [general]
    ignore_critical no-ptp-subsystem no-ptp-clock
    ```
- Write running configuration into state directory as a diagnostic. (SWPTP-198)
- Control system clock flags to let kernel set RTC when in sync. (SWPTP-216)
- Add `manual-startup` selection policy to start with a configured sync
  instance before moving onto automatic selection. (SWPTP-823)
- Add separate trace component to help understand the detailed reason for
  changes in sync instance selection. Disable in normal use to avoid excessive
  logging.
    ```
    [general]
    trace_level bic 3
    ```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restarting chronyd is destabilising for NTP synchronisation so this
> feature should be avoided when chrony's time sync performance influences
> sync instance selection. In the absence of native runtime control for
> chronyd it is best used in an always-on or always-off mode with sfptpd. If
> chronyd control is required for fallback it is advisable to give it a
> lower (numerically higher) `priority` setting so it is only selected on
> total failure of PTP and to increase `selection_holdoff_period` to 60s.
> Similarly, it would not be recommended to use this clock control method
> while chrony was operating as a clustering determinant (i.e. discriminator).

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to be *explicit* about whether or not sfptpd should talk
> to the chrony service to be resilient to future changes in defaults, by
> using the `sync_module` option to enable or disable it.
> (Added: 2023-10-27)

### Changed

- Make `correct-clock` the default mode for the epoch guard. This option has
  proven effective and reliable since its introduction. (SWPTP-1283)

### Fixed

- Issue SWPTP-1257
  - It is not fatal for the system clock not to be using the superior TSC.
- Issue SWPTP-1264
  - Drop check for ancient driver/fw versions, avoiding parse failures
    for in-tree drivers in new kernels.
- Issue SWPTP-1280
  - Only use Allan Variance in clock source comparisons when measured by
    both sources, otherwise fall through to next selection criterion.
- Issue SWPTP-1281
  - Allow for delayed first sample when using PPS clock diff method; helps
    when using in-tree sfc driver.

## [3.5.0.1004] - 2022-05-13 [Feature Release]

### Added

- Support in-tree driver (SWPTP-211)  
  Out-of-tree driver from support-nic.xilinx.com is recommended for best
  performance.
- Allow configuration of preferred order of clock diff methods
  for non-Xilinx NICs (SWPTP-1193), e.g.:
    ```
    [general]
    phc_diff_methods sys-offset-precise pps sys-offset-ext sys-offset read-time
    ```
- Support synchronisation to PPS inputs via `/dev/pps` or `/dev/ptp`.
  The preferred order of methods can also be configured (SWPTP-1164), e.g.:
    ```
    [general]
    phc_pps_methods devpps devptp
    ```
- Assume multiple PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) devices presented by the same
  PCI device represent the same underlying clock, which is often the case
  for non-Xilinx NICs. Enabled by default. (SWPTP-1181)
  - To disable:
     ```
     [general]
     assume_one_phc_per_nic off
    ```
- Allow hardware or software timestamping to be required for a given PTP
  sync instance and refuse to start if requirement cannot be met (SWPTP-212)
    ```
    [ptp1]
    timestamping hw
    ```
- Allow maximum NIC clock skew amount to be limited to less than its
  advertised capabilities in ppb (SWPTP-815), e.g.:
    ```
    [general]
    limit_freq_adj 50000000
    ```
- Decode advertised PTP clock accuracy to ns in state files (SWPTP-1045)
- Support `PTP_SYS_OFFSET_EXTENDED` clock diff method (SWPTP-1187)
- Allow control socket location to be specified (SWPTP-624)
- Detect if `systemd-timesyncd` is running (SWPTP-986)
- Alarm secondary servo on 30s of sustained sync failure (SWPTP-1049)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is no longer clear that `assume_one_phc_per_nic off` is the most
> effective solution for working around the limitations of the way
> PHC clocks are made available on non-Solarflare interfaces and users
> may be better off selecting an explicit `clock_list` for third party NICs.
> (Added: 2023-10-26)

### Fixed

- Issue SWPTP-1203
  - Synchronise normal thread activity start to avoid premature inter-thread
    messaging
- Issue SWPTP-1188
  - Show offset as only a comparison in stats when ntpd not disciplining
- Issue SWPTP-1184
  - Fix failure to configure hardware timestamping where one interface in a
    bond only supports software timestamping
- Issue SWPTP-1183
  - Fix use of PPS clock diff method for non-Xilinx NICs after a step

## [3.4.1.1000] - 2021-12-16

### Added
- Allow PTP as PPS time-of-day source (SWPTP-1163)
  - A single sync instance can be specified in a global PPS section, e.g.:
    ```
    [pps]
    time_of_day ptp1
    ```

### Fixed

- Issue SWPTP-1172
  - Handle reference clocks and unreachable peers reported by chronyd suitably
    rather than crashing with an assertion failure
- Issue SWPTP-424
  - Propagate time and frequency traceability flags from PPS to PTP

## [3.4.0.1003] - 2021-10-29 [Feature Release]

### Added

- Add simple clustering algorithm between sync instances (SWPTP-421).  
  In this mode a passive sync instance (e.g. NTP) is designated as the
 'discriminator' between multiple active sync instances (e.g. PTP) to
  allow wildly divergent time sources to be excluded in sync instance
  selection.
  Example configuration for preferring instances within 100ms of NTP ref:
    ```
    [general]
    clustering discriminator ntp1 100000000 1
    ```
- Extend interoperability with chronyd (SWPTP-978).  
  Support chronyd as NTP server when either sfptpd or chronyd is
  statically configured not to discipline the system clock. For example,
  to enable the chronyd + PPS use case launch chronyd with the `-x` option.
- Support the draft PTP Enterprise Profile (SWPTP-975).  
  Suitable defaults and configuration constraints can be selected by using
  the following option, which should appear before other options.
    ```
    [ptp]
    ptp_profile enterprise
    ```
  See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tictoc-ptp-enterprise-profile-21
- Support the IEEE1588-2019 revision of the PTP standard (SWPTP-591).  
  Implementations of the 2019 revision, known informally as PTP v2.1, should
  be backwards compatible with implementations of the 2008 revision (v2.0)
  but to assure continued interoperability with intolerant peer devices
  the protocol version must be specified to use new features, such as the
  `COMMUNICATION_CAPABILITIES` TLV:
    ```
    [ptp]
    ptp_version 2.1
    ```
- Support for the IPv6/UDP PTP transport (annex E) (SWPTP-601).
  The link-local and global scopes are supported. Example configuration:
    ```
    [ptp]
    transport ipv6
    scope link-local
    ```
- Add `probe-only` interface detection mode to avoid Netlink (SWPTP-1145):
  `hotplug_detection_mode probe`.
- Raise alarm on secondary servos that fail to operate continuously for 30
  seconds or more such as due to clock comparison failure. (SWPTP-1049).
- Use `COMMUNICATIONS_CAPABILITIES` TLV to agree multicast vs unicast delay
  request capabilities with corresponding PTP node (SWPTP-687).
- Extend application of 'epoch guard' for hosts with multiple NICs.
  (SWPTP-1109)
- Convert example scripts to python 3 (SWPTP-957).
- Report outlier statistics in long term stats (SWPTP-540).

> [!TIP]
> While similar to the sfptpd Best Master Clock (BMC) Discriminator
> feature, the 'clustering' feature operates between sync instances
> (i.e. on separate PTP domains and/or interfaces) rather than within
> a PTP domain and is a preferable solution because full clock reconstruction
> is continuously performed for each candidate source.

> [!NOTE]
> Frequent outliers are always expected to show up in statistics as they
> are intrinsic to the adaptive algorithm.

### Fixed
- Issue SWPTP-1098, SWPTP-1102
  - Fix `clock_readonly` option.
- Issue SWPTP-1091
  - Correct handling of timestamp when `Follow_Up` messages received or handled
    ahead of `Sync`, occasionally resulting in large time jumps.
- Issue SWPTP-1078
  - Fix invalid JSON in real time stats output.
- Issue SWPTP-895
  - Serialise log rotation with log writing to avoid broken output.
- Issue SWPTP-844, SWPTP-1150
  - Fix association of PTP sync instances to interfaces when there are multiple
    instances on multiple interfaces so that correct operation is no longer
    sensitive to ordering in configuration.

## [3.3.1.1001] - 2020-10-02

### Added
- New `step-on-first-lock` clock control mode (SWPTP-1032)
  - Add mode to allow clock steps after first lock onto a PTP master.
  - This mode addresses the unintuitive behaviour of `step-at-startup` when
    there are multiple local clocks that have already been slewing to NIC.
- Configurable bond/hotplug detection mode (SWPTP-1041)
  - Add option to detect bond changes only via netlink events to avoid
    expensive polling of bond state when teamd in use.
  - Enable with `hotplug_detection_mode netlink`.

### Fixed
- Issue SWPTP-1002
  - Propagate `TIME_TRACEABLE` flag when acting both as master and slave
- Issue SWPTP-1005
  - Consider UTC offset in advertisement when computing BMC discriminator offset
- Issue SWPTP-1037
  - Correct handling of cached `Follow_Up` messages received ahead of Sync

## [v3.3.0.1007] - 2020-03-03 [Feature Release]

### Added
- BMC Discriminator (SWPTP-906)  
  Provide option to disqualify PTP masters which advertise a time that
  differs by more than a given threshold from a specific time source such
  as the selected NTP server.
- Hybrid Network Mode Without Fallback (SWPTP-684)  
  Provide a new mode for DelayReq/DelayResp messaging that does not fall
  back to multicast when there is no response.
- Freerun with System Clock (SWPTP-884)  
  Allow the system clock to be used as the clock source with the freerunning
  sync module. In combination with other options this enables sfptpd to
  operate alongside chronyd for some use cases.
- Epoch Guard (SWPTP-908)  
  Detect when a local clock has been reset to 1970, e.g. on an unexpected
  NIC reset and raise an alarm, prevent it being used to synchronise other
  clocks (default behaviour) and/or step it immediately.
- Chronyd (SWPTP-565)  
  Support limited use cases where sfptpd operates alongside chronyd with
  read-only access to the system clock. Due to chronyd not supporting
  external control of whether it disciplines clocks it is still recommended
  to disable chronyd and install ntpd where NTP functionality is desired.
- Systemd example (SWPTP-536)  
  Install a systemd unit file to start sfptpd instead of a sysv-style
  initscript and an example configuration file suitable for passive
  operation alongside chronyd.
- Configurable state path (SWPTP-909)  
  Provide `state_path` option to change the location of sfptpd state files.
- Slave UTC override option (SWPTP-726)  
  A new option `ptp_utc_offset_handling override <N>` uses a fixed UTC
  offset of N seconds regardless of any offset announced by PTP masters.
  This option aids interoperability with faulty GMs but requires manual
  intervention to handle leap seconds.
- Log sync instance alarm changes (SWPTP-988)  
  Any change in alarms or lack of alarms is shown in the message log.

> [!NOTE]
> The [sync instances clustering feature](#3401003---2021-10-29-feature-release)
> is preferred to the BMC discriminator wherever possible. The use case for
> the BMC discriminator is rogue time sources within a single PTP domain on
> the same interface. (Added: 2023-10-26)

### Fixed
